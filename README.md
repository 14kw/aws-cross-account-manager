# aws-cross-account-manager
The Cross Account Manager Solution provides a way for users to easily access the AWS management console without storing or remembering the root or IAM credentials. The user can federate to different AWS account(s) and IAM Roles based on the permissions. The solution will be deployed in a dedicated customerâ€™s Master AWS account from where users can federate into other Sub AWS accounts. If the user has permission to assume the desired role in desired Sub account, he/she will be able to federate to that account. The permissions will be managed from the Master account.
